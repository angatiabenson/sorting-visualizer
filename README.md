# Sorting Visualizer

## Introduction
Sorting Visualizer is an interactive Android application that demonstrates the mechanics of various sorting algorithms through animation. It is designed to help users understand how different algorithms approach the task of sorting data by visualizing the process in real time.

## Features
- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms**: Supports a variety of sorting algorithms including:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Bucket Sort
  - Count Sort
  - Heap Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Pigeonhole Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Shell Sort

- **Data Randomization**: Allows users to randomize the dataset to see how algorithms perform under different data conditions.

- **Visualization**: Utilizes `com.github.mikephil.charting.charts.BarChart` to animate the sorting process with bar charts representing data elements.

- **Adjustable Animation Speed**: Users can control the speed of the sorting animation to better observe the sorting process.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface for users of all levels.

## Installation

To get started with Sorting Visualizer, clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/angatiabenson/sorting-visualizer
```

After cloning, navigate to the project directory and build the project using Android Studio.

## Usage

1. Open the app on your Android device.
2. Use the slide to increase and generate a new dataset.
3. Select a sorting algorithm from the list provided.
4. Select the animation speed desired.
5. Then it will begin the visualization automatically.
